Today day 1 of Learning Data Structures and Algorithms,
in 1hr 16min youtube video I learned the following
1) Introduction to Number system from tally mark to Binary.
2) Why do computers read Bindary language only.
3) High level language to low level language.

I don't have Idea about DSA but in my upcoming semesters there will a subject on this subject, also I am curious to learn,
So I started with this YouTube challenge where they will upload a video at 6AM every day for next 179 days (Today Day 1),
I just have to watch the video and understand about the various topics of DSA and practice whatever they give for home work,

So I accepted the challenge and I will be consistent in completing the tasks and dedicate my self atleast 2hr every day for next 179 days,
Hope everything goes well.
